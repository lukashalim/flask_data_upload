 Website with Flask and Python for Data Analysis

I'm taking a Python course which recommends working on archived Python projects on Freelancer.com. One of the recommended projects is a website with flask and python for dat analysis. Link to the blog post with the project [here](https://blog.finxter.com/how-real-freelancers-earn-money-in-2019-10-practical-python-projects/) and link to the project on freelancer.com [here](https://www.freelancer.com/projects/javascript/website-with-Flask-python-for/).

>The project consists of creating a page with the Flask framework in order to let the user analyze textual data.
The idea is to let the user upload their dataset (in format like CSV, TSV, etc.)
After that have some options to customize the upload (choosing the separator, header existing or not, strings are quoted or not, etc…).
Once the dataset is loaded the user can choose the type for each column (numerical data, strings, etc.).
After that, the user selects the columns containing the verbatims and click on an analyze button.
The data is then pushed to the backend where I’ll have python scripts to do text classification and other Machine learning models that I’ve developed.
Tip: I would recommend that you simply assume that the analytics part is handled by the client. You can simply use any CSV data you can lay your hands on or create a small file yourself.
